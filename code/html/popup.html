      <h2>About this extension</h2>
      <p>By working everyday on building a powerful and user friendly search engine, we've became obsessed with search experience, testing it on every website or mobile app we happen to land on. At Algolia we use GitHub everyday and their searchbar was a persistent discussion, so we remade it like we thought it should be for a daily use.</p>
